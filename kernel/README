Quick and dirty instructions on building this into the kernel

1) Patch kernel (to add to fs/Kconfig, fs/Makefile):

$ cd linux
$ patch -p1 < ~/ceph/trunk/ceph/kernel/kconfig.patch
patching file fs/Kconfig
patching file fs/Makefile

2) Symlink (adjust path to ceph source accordingly)

$ ln -s ~/ceph/trunk/ceph/kernel fs/ceph
$ ln -s ~/ceph/trunk/ceph/include/ceph_fs.h include/linux

3) Enable CONFIG_CEPH_FS in .config.  Ceph should now be the first item under File Systems -> Network File Systems.  

4) Build!
