; Sample ceph cluster.conf file.
;
; This file defines cluster membership and the various locations
; that Ceph stores data.
;
; NOTE: This file ONLY includes options relating to starting and
; stopping ceph daemons.  For runtime options, see ceph.conf.

; If a 'host' is defined for a daemon, the start/stop script will
; verify that it matches the hostname (or else ignore it).  If it is
; not defined, it is assumed that the daemon is intended to start on
; the current host (e.g., in a setup with a startup.conf on each
; node).
